# Problem statement

## Background

The increasing number of online publications has made the name ambiguity problem more complex. Moreover, the inaccurate disambiguation results have led to invalid author rankings and award cheating. This competition hope participants develop a model to discover paper assignment errors for given authors.

## Task

Given each author’s profile, including author name and published papers, participants are asked to develop a model to detect incorrect paper assignments among all one’s papers. The paper attributes are provided, including title, abstract, authors, keywords, venue, and publication year.
