## Project goal
- get A on assignment?

    **General group preference**

- get onto leaderboard?

## Project choice

### Incorrect assignment detection (IND)

Given the paper assignments of each author and paper metadata, the goal is to detect paper assignment errors for each author. 

- simplicity
- **general group preference**

### Academic  question answering (AQA)

Given professional questions and a pool of candidate papers, the objective is to retrieve the most relevant papers to answer these questions. 

- seems more involved

### Paper source tracing (PST)

Given the full texts of each paper, the goal is to automatically trace the most significant references that have inspired a given paper.

- challenging
- requires very powerful transformer model capable of processing scientific papers
- "inspiration" is very vague

## Dummy submission (19th of April)
- All teams need to submit a dummy submission to the contest portal for their chosen task
- Deadline: April 19, 11:59PM

Steps:

- Run the baseline code provided for your chosen task
- Prepare the dummy submission file according to the specified format
- Submit the dummy file to the contest portal
- Verify that the submission was successful and meets the requirements
    
## GitHub / Google Drive setup
- Matthew will create group shared repo
