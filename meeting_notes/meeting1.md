### Adithi Ramesh
 year CS major. I've taken most of the ML and Data Science electives offered so I have a basic understanding of the diff models and have worked with pandas, matplotlib, etc. I'm quite confident with python.

## Project goal
- get A on assignment?
 Preference

- get onto leaderboard?

## Project choice

### Incorrect assignment detection (IND)

Given the paper assignments of each author and paper metadata, the goal is to detect paper assignment errors for each author. 

- simplicity
- **general group preference**

### Academic  question answering (AQA)

Given professional questions and a pool of candidate papers, the objective is to retrieve the most relevant papers to answer these questions. 

- seems more involved

### Paper source tracing (PST)

Given the full texts of each paper, the goal is to automatically trace the most significant references that have inspired a given paper.

- challenging
- requires very powerful transformer model capable of processing scientific papers
- "inspiration" is very vague

## Dummy submission (19th of April)
- to get access to LLM tokens
- limited weekly submissions -- start early
- Ask professor
- Check TA discussion slide
    
## GitHub / Google Drive setup
- Matthew will create group shared repo
